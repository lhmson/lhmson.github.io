### More Information

I have the ability to implement practical IT strategies combined with human interaction at a wide variety of levels. My greatest strength is effectively communicating with others, which enables me to utilize the power of teamwork in any working environment.  

I was originally a student who study languages (English) at high school, as well as a freelance English translator (2015-2018) so used to connecting everyone by ideas and messages.
